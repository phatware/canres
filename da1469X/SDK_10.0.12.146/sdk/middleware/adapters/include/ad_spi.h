/*
 *
 * Terminology:
 *      Adapter:    A middleware abstraction layer for using a controller. It provides the following services:
 *                  - Arbitration in accessing the controller (between multiple masters, multiple tasks)
 *                  - Configuration of the controller
 *                  - Block sleep while the controller is in use
 *      Controller: Top level view of SPI peripheral, including the complete configuration needed for being fully functional (IOs, DMAs, Driver configuration)
 *      Driver:     The Low Level Driver associated with the controller
 *      SPI:        The controller name (e.g SPI1, SPI2)
 *
 * API example usage:
 *      ad_spi_init():           Called by the system on power up for initializing the adapter. It should NOT be called by the application
 *      ad_spi_io_config():      Called by the application for configuring the controller interface before powering up the external connected devices (e.g sensors)
 *
 *      ad_spi_open();           Called by the application for starting a transaction. The sleep is blocked until ad_spi_close() is called. No other task or master can start a new transaction using the same controller instance
 *      ad_spi_write();          Blocking write - caller task will block until the resource becomes available
 *      ad_spi_read();           Blocking read  - caller task will block until the resource becomes available
 *      ad_spi_reconfig();
 *      ad_spi_write_async();    Non blocking write - caller task should retry until function returns no error. It will then be notified when transaction is completed
 *      ad_spi_read_async();     Non blocking read  - caller task should retry until function returns no error. It will then be notified when transaction is completed
 *      ad_spi_close();          Called by the application for releasing the resource. System is allowed to go to sleep (if no other module blocks sleep)
