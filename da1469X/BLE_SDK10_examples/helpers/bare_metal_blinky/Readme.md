## Example description 

This is a simple implementation of a basic blinky application that runs "bare metal" without FreeRTOS. Bluetooth LE is NOT supported by this example.

**Note** 
The example can be downloaded from [Here](http://lpccs-docs.dialog-semiconductor.com/SW_Example/SDK10/DA1469x_Bare_Metal_Blinky.zip).

## HW and SW configuration


* **Hardware configuration**

	- This example runs on DA1469x Bluetooth Smart SoC devices.
	- A PRO or USB Development kit is needed for this example.
	- Connect the Development kit to the host computer.

* **Software configuration**

- This example requires:

    * Smartsnippets Studio 2.0.16 or greater
    * SDK 10.0.10.118 or greater
	* SEGGER J-Link tools should be downloaded and installed.

## How to run the example

### Initial Setup
